DFProxy is a client and a proxy bundled into one - a central proxy with many users that enables many unprecendented features. Client-side mods like our predecessor [DFTools](https://github.com/KSashaDF/DFTools) (previously DFUtils) were only able to achieve what was limited by the client - but DFProxy is a new take on modifying and enhancing the [DiamondFire experience](https://mcdiamondfire.com).
