DFProxy is a proxy that tunnels your connection to DiamondFire - a central proxy with many users that enables many unprecendented features. Client-side mods like our predecessor [DFTools](https://github.com/KSashaDF/DFTools) (previously DFUtils) were only able to achieve what was limited by the client - but DFProxy is a new take on modifying and enhancing the [DiamondFire experience](https://mcdiamondfire.com).

Things like custom commands, custom actions (send resource pack, send to plot) and more server-based features are all included in DFProxy.
